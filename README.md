# bens-shitty-gameboy
Just like it says on the box: a pretty shitty "gameboy" that I learned a lot from making.

I made this repository after already finishing a working version of the BSG (Ben's Shitty "Gameboy"), because I think knowing how to use git and Github is valuable knowledge and learning within a context is far more effective than without.

Basic list of features (and their implementation status):
1.	6 hardware-debounced buttons (4 in a D-Pad arrangement + A & B)		Done
2.	A 128x64 LCD Screen													Done
3.	Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)										Done
4.	38kHz Infrared receiver												Done
5.	Infrared transmitter												Not Done
6.	Capacitive button													Not Done

Planned features will be added to a TODO document rather than here I think.
