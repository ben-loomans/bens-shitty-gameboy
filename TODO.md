This file will contain some ideas I have for future versions of this project, regardless of how strongly I intend to implement them.

* Battery power - having a laptop attached to the BSG isn't ideal
* Case - 3D printed case with buttons and possibly a screen protector
* Speaker
* SD cartridge - load games from an SD card
* Colour display - issues associated with cost however
* Buttons with more travel
